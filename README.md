👋 Hi there, I’m Jonathan (he/him)  
I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with a love for building engaging and user-friendly web applications.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me:  
🎮 Immersed in video games or board games  
🍰 Experimenting with baking delicious treats  
🧶 Crafting cozy creations through crocheting  
📽️ Rewatching Pixar classics on loop

🌱 What I'm Working On  
As a Front End Developer, I specialize in creating clean, functional, and scalable user interfaces. I'm currently honing my skills in modern frameworks like React and Svelte, as well as exploring tools like TailwindCSS for sleek design and efficient development.
