- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jehr_ or Jonathan (he/him)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, board games, eating potatoes, woodworking, and putting Pixar movies on repeat. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux and Python with much more to come, as I am seeking my degree in Programming. 
- :computer: I'm currently working in prototype automotive as a project engineer. It is hardly my passion, but it does have rewarding moments.
